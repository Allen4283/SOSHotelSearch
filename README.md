SOS Hotel Search
===

Description
---
SOS Hotel Search is a java-based application that allows users to find the right hotel to suit their needs. There are two types of users: hotel searchers and hotel owners. Hotel searchers can search for hotels by location to find their ideal hotel. The search results will appear on a map and on a list which can be sorted by price. Once the user finds a hotel to their liking, they can book a reservation and write a review of the hotel. Hotel owners can look at reservations made for their hotels.

Dependencies
---
* Java 8
* Derby Embedded Library
* JxMaps API
* Users must have internet access for the map to function properly

Installation
---
Double click the SOS Hotel Search .jar file located in the SOSHotelSearch_jar folder to run the application. If it does not run, make sure you have Java installed on your computer.

NOTE: If the program does not run, or you seem to be stuck on the login/register screen, please run the application through the command line. You can do this by pointing to the directory of the SOSHotelSearch.jar file (for example, in command line type "cd C:/users/yourName/SOSHotelSearch-master/SOSHotelSearch_jar") and then running the command "java -jar SOSHotelSearch.jar".

Usage
---
When the program begins, you will be prompted to login with a username and password. If you do not have an account, click on the "Sign Up" tab. This will allow you to enter information to create an account. You must select either hotel searcher or hotel owner to determine what type of account this will be, as this will determine what features you can use. Once you have created your account, you will be able to login.

**Hotel Searcher Usage:**

Once logged in as a hotel searcher, you will be brought to the navigation dashboard. Here, you will enter the criteria for your desired hotel in the search fields, including the location, the check-in and check-out dates, and the rooms. After entering these requirements and clicking search, you will see a list of hotels along with a map displaying those hotels. Above the list, you can click "Sort" to sort the list by price. Click on a hotel, and you can see more details about it.

When viewing a hotel, you can see three pictures of the hotel. Click "Book It", and you will be able to enter your payment information to complete the reservation. Once your reservation is made, you will receive a confrmation message. Back on the hotel's information screen (the one with images of the hotel), you may look at user reviews by clicking on "View Reviews". Here you can also write your own review and give a rating to the hotel.

**Hotel Owner Usage:**

Hotel owner accounts will have access to a list of reservations made to their hotels. On this screen, hotel owners can see which hotels have reservations, the check-in date, the check-out date, and the number of rooms reserved.
