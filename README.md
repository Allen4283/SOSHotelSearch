SOS Hotel Search is a java-based application that allows users to find the right hotel to suit their needs. There are two types of users: hotel searchers and hotel owners. Hotel searchers can search for hotels based on location, price, and size to find their ideal hotel. The search results will appear in a list and on a map, and the user will be able to select a hotel and make a reservation. Hotel owners can add their own hotel to the data and edit their hotel's innformation.

When the program begins, you will be prompted to login with a username and password. If you do not have an account, click on the "Don't have an account" button. This will allow you to enter information to create an account. You must select either hotel searcher or hotel owner to determine what type of account this will be, as this will determine what features you can use. Once you have created your account, you will be able to login.

**Customer Usage:**

Once logged in as a customer, you will be brought to the navigation dashboard. Here, you will type the criteria for your desired hotel in the search fields, including the location, the check-in and check-out dates, and the rooms. After entering these requirements and clicking search, you will see a list of hotels along with a map displaying those hotels. Above the list, you can add filters to your search, or you can sort the list. Click on a hotel, and you can see more details about it. You may look at user reviews by clicking on "Go to Reviews", and you can also write a review. Hotels can also be saved for later reference. Click "Book It", and you will be able to enter your payment information to complete the reservation. Once your reservation is made, you will receive a confrmation message.
